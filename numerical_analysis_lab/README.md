# Numerical Analysis Lab

This repository contains the code for the Numerical Analysis Lab.

## Setup Instructions

To get started with the project, follow these steps to set up the environment:

### 1. Create a Virtual Environment

First, create a virtual environment for the project by running:

```bash
python3 -m venv .venv
```

### Intsall Dependencies
Next, install the necessary dependencies. Run the following command to install all required Python packages:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

This will install all the dependencies listed in the `requirements.txt` file.

### Launch Jupyter Lab
Once the environment is set up and dependencies are installed, start Jupyter Lab by running:

```bash
$ jupyter lab
```

### Run the Notebook
After Jupyter Lab opens in your browser, navigate to the notebook in the project directory and run all the cells. The code should run without errors.
