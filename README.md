# Mathematics

A collection of C++ and Python code implementing various mathematical concepts covered in the math courses I am taking or have taken. This includes coursework examples.
## Topics Covered

*   **Numerical Analysis:**
    *   Function Approximation (Taylor series for `sin(x)`, `e^x`) - C++
    *   Numerical Integration (Trapezoidal Rule, Simpson's Rule, Gaussian Quadrature) - Python
*   **Abstract Algebra:**
    *   Finding Generators for Cyclic Subgroups (e.g., Z_n) - Python

## Languages

*   C++
*   Python (using libraries like `numpy`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`)

## Usage

Navigate into the relevant directories or files. Code may require compilation (C++) or specific Python libraries (check imports). Individual files often contain usage examples or comments.
